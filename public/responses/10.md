*Question: How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?*

Response:

I believe two main changes could happen to this exercise:

1. Don't limit the responder to just an hour. After I started to get my ideas out, they just kept on coming. If I had taken an hour on this, I wouldn't have been able to answer every question as thoroughly as I would like, which in some cases wouldn't show my true potential as a community manager.

2. Broaden the scope of the first question. I don't read many technical papers or guides not relating to programming/web dev, and I haven't seen a lightning talk in some time. I would change this to include video essays, such as the one I discussed in my response.
