*Question: If you could make one change to our [flagship community](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions), what would it be and why?*

Response:

The change I would personally make to the flagship community would be to make it less like a general support forum and more like an actual community. Now, moving the whole thing over to somewhere like Discord might be something not possible currently, but having something as simple as a thread dedicated for people to simply talk to one another would create the baseline needed for a community to grow and eventually thrive.

Also, while not about the community itself, making sure people know about the community is very important. Before my interview with Scott, even after using Vercel for a few months, I had *no idea* the community even existed. If I had an issue, I simply googled it which usually leads to Stack Overflow and third party websites.

As far as I can tell, Vercel has talked about this support platform nowhere, with the only mention of its existence on twitter [being a response by Guillermo to someone](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fcommunity%2Fdiscussions&src=typed_query&f=top) and *seemingly* only resulting in a dissapointment that they were [unable to get help](https://twitter.com/Mitsunee/status/1484947451773661202). 

Now I don't want to leave this on a negative note, so I have to say that every platform has room to grow and improve, which for Vercel's community I am really excited for, especially since there is so much potential. I truly think that it can grow into the next big thing in the programming space online, with a crucial part of that being someone who knows what they're doing, (and I don't mean to sound self-promoting here) like me.
