*Question: Would, or how would, you improve the response shared with a customer [here](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions/310)?*

Response:

One of the first things I noticed here was where the customer states:

---

"I've seen tangential discussions on here but *haven't found this exact issue discussed.*"

---
 
which tells me that any existing docs or discussions probably don't suffice in explaining to the user how to accomplish what they want. Because of this I probably don't want to leave a generic response and leave a link to the Vercel docs, like what we see in Sam's answer (sorry Sam, just the truth here). Also this somewhat passive aggressive response can leave the community with a sort of toxic feel, especially to new users: just look at the reputation of Stack Overflow.

A better approach would be to not only link the docs, but leave a little sample script as well, like this:

Hey [name], hope your day is going well!

Assuming that each of these folders has a separate project on Vercel, we're going to take advantage of a cool feature called [Ignore Build Step](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel). Essentially, you can pass a command which Vercel will run to determine whether or not it needs to run the build step again. If the command returns a code 0, the build step will be skipped, but if its 1 or higher, the build step will run. Additionally, the last 10 revisions of your git history are available to the running command, so we can use this to our advantage to determine if any changes have happened since the previous commit.

Before I jump into an example script, I want to break this down into the base parts, first being how we determine if any changes occured in a certain folder since the last commit. Starting off, we use `git diff` and `wc` to first get a list of changes between the last two commits and then count that number of changes.

`git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD [path] | wc -l`

To explain each part of this command more easily, I have made a small table:

|Command|What it Does|
|-|-|
|`git diff`|Tells `git` that we need a list of changes between two commits.|
|`--name-only`|We only need the names of the files changed, not every bit of info.|
|`HEAD^`|The first commit should be the 2nd to last commit to the git repository.|
|`HEAD`|The second commit should be the most recent commit to the git repository.|
|`[path]`|The folder we want to look for changes in. We would leave this blank if we only wanted the changes of the CWD|
|`\|`|Take the output of the previous command and "pipe" it into the input of the next command.|
|`wc -l`|Count the number of lines from the given input.|

With your example project layout, we need to check if there are changes in the project directory and a separate shared directory. Bash has a cool feature which allows you to run multiple commands at once and combine their outputs, like this:

`{ command1; command2; }`

So if we wanted to check the changes in the current folder and a folder at the same level called `veryimportantfolder` we would use a command like this to see how many changes happened across both between the last 2 commmits:

`{ git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ; git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ../verimportantfolder ; } | wc -l`

---

Now that you understand how all of this works at a higher level, I'll make a little example script which *should* work in your scenario. For each of your projects, you would just need to have this script in its folder along with customizing the [Ignored Build Step setting] to have this script run. For this example, i'm going to call this script `check-to-build.sh` and I would set the command in the setting to `bash check-to-build.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

numOfChanges=$({ git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ../common; git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD; } | wc -l)

echo "Number of Changes:"
echo $numOfChanges

if (( numOfChanges > 0 )) ; then
  # Proceed with the build
  echo "âœ… - Build can proceed"
  exit 1;

else
  # Don't build
  echo "ðŸ›‘ - Build cancelled"
  exit 0;
fi
```

The command first gets the number of changes between the last two commits and if the number is above 0, runs the build; otherwise the build is cancelled.

I hope I answered your question accordingly and if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know and I hope you have a nice day!

In my opinion, this is a better example of a response for various reasons. It starts off with a short and concise intro, explains why the main part of the answer works, leaves a short example which will work for the original answer asking, and then concludes with a polite closing. This ends up creating a baseline for others to work with in the future since explaining the different parts of the command used will make it easier for others to adjust the resulting script to their needs. 

While this might have been a bit too in depth, it did lack small bits of knowledge in the [article linked by Sam](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel), such as how to count the number of file changes between two git commits in a folder and how to run two commands while concatenating ther outputs. One thing I do have to say though is that the article did provide an incredible base line for me to work off of while crafting my answer, as you can probably tell by the similarity between my example script and those seen in the article. The documentation and support articles in their current form are more than enouth for experienced users, but there will always be more begineer users who need that extra little bit of help on how to solve an issue, as we can see in this scenario.
