*Question: Would, or how would, you improve the response shared with a customer [here](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions/310)?*

Response:

One of the first things I noticed here was where the customer states:

---

"I've seen tangential discussions on here but *haven't found this exact issue discussed.*"

---
 
This tells me that any existing docs or discussions probably won't suffice in explaining to the user how to accomplish what they want. Because of this, I probably don't want to leave a generic response and leave a link to the Vercel docs, like what we see in Sam's answer (sorry, Sam, just the truth here). Also, this somewhat passive-aggressive response can leave the community with a sort of toxic feel, especially to new users: look at the reputation of Stack Overflow.

A better approach would be to not only link the docs but leave a little sample script as well, like this:

Hey [name], hope your day is going well!

Assuming that each of these folders has a separate project on Vercel, we will take advantage of a cool feature called [Ignore Build Step](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel). Essentially, you can pass a command which Vercel will run to determine whether or not it needs to rerun the build step. If the command returns a code 0, the build step will be skipped, but the build step will run if it's one or higher. Additionally, the last ten revisions of your git history are available to the running command, so we can use this to determine if any changes have happened since the previous commit.

Before I jump into an example script, I want to break this down into the base parts, the first being how we determine if any changes occurred in a particular folder since the last commit. We use `git diff` and `wc` to first get a list of changes between the previous two commits and then count that number of changes.

`git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD [path] | wc -l`

To explain each part of this command more easily, I have made a small table:

|Command|What it Does|
|-|-|
|`git diff`|Tells `git` that we need a list of changes between two commits.|
|`--name-only`|We only need the names of the files changed, not every bit of info.|
|`HEAD^`|The first commit should be the 2nd to last commit to the git repository.|
|`HEAD`|The second commit should be the most recent commit to the git repository.|
|`[path]`|The folder we want to look for changes in. We would leave this blank if we only wanted the changes of the CWD|
|`\|`|Take the output of the previous command and "pipe" it into the input of the next command.|
|`wc -l`|Count the number of lines from the given input.|

With your example project layout, we need to check if there are changes in the project directory and a separate shared directory. Bash has a cool feature that allows you to run multiple commands at once and combine their outputs, like this:

`{ command1; command2; }`

So if we wanted to check the changes in the current folder and a folder at the same level called `veryimportantfolder` we would use a command like this to see how many changes happened across both between the last 2 commits:

`{ git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ; git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ../verimportantfolder ; } | wc -l`

---

Now that you understand how this works at a higher level, I'll make a little example script that *should* work in your scenario. For each of your projects, you would need to have this script in its folder and customize the [Ignored Build Step setting](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#ignored-build-step) to have this script run. For this example, I will call this script `check-to-build.sh`, and on Vercel, I would set the command to `bash check-to-build.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

numOfChanges=$({ git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD ../common; git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD; } | wc -l)

echo "Number of Changes:"
echo $numOfChanges

if (( numOfChanges > 0 )) ; then
  # Proceed with the build
  echo "âœ… - Build can proceed"
  exit 1;

else
  # Don't build
  echo "ðŸ›‘ - Build cancelled"
  exit 0;
fi
```

The command first gets the number of changes between the last two commits and, if the number is above 0, runs the build; otherwise, the build is canceled.

I hope I answered your question accordingly and if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know; I hope you have a nice day!

In my opinion, this is a better example of a response for various reasons. First, it starts with a short intro, explains why the main part of the answer works, leaves a quick example that will work for the original answer asking, and concludes with a polite closing. This creates a baseline for others to work with in the future since explaining the different parts of the command used will make it easier for others to adjust the resulting script to their needs. 

While this might have been a bit too in-depth, it did lack small bits of knowledge in the [article linked by Sam](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel), such as how to count the number of file changes between two git commits in a folder and how to run two commands while concatenating their outputs. I have to say, though: the article did provide an excellent baseline for me to work off of while crafting my answer, as you can probably tell by the similarity between my example script and those seen in the article. The documentation and support articles in their current form are more than enough for experienced users. Still, there will always be more beginner users who need that extra little bit of help on how to solve an issue, as we can see in this scenario.
