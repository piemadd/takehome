*Question: What does Community mean to you?*

Response: 

A community can mean various things to me, really depending on what community it is, but I feel like what makes a community a community is the most important. When people come together sharing a common interest, they tend to make friendships and share their various findings. At a very high level, this is what makes a community. 

Over my lifetime, I have been a part of various communities on a variety of platforms, being old enough to still participate in forums (like [LinusTechTips.com](https://linustechtips.com)) but young enough to get into Discord early on. I would spend hours chatting with friends, playing video games, and creating bonds with people halfway across the world. I would meet people, and it would seem like we had been friends for years within a few hours. I am still friends with some of these people all of these years later (some I have even met in person), others I haven't spoken to in 2-3 years. 

These communities are what defined me as a person, and Replit's community (previous employer) isn't an exception to this. Even before I applied for and got a job, I was active on their discord server, which was more than just a support area for the company. It was a place for people to chat, play games, debug, team up, etc. I made friends with many active community members, which helped me immensely when I became an employee. I wasn't just some random stranger coming in to manage the community these people had accustomed to; I was one of them. 

When it comes to community management, the most crucial part isn't how many likes or shares a post gets, how many people are chatting at once, or anything else related to pure statistics. The most crucial part is that the community manager and the community are on the same level, not a higher up in charge of a group of people. This creates an emotional bond between the various community members, to the point that it would seem to be a group of friends helping one another, not a support group. 

I hope I answered your question the best I can, as the answer isn't very straightforward and has an infinite number of responses, but I spoke from my heart and my experience as to what this all means to me.
