*Question: What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask
Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common
problems, short-term and long-term?*

Response:

Chances are, there is no *one* most common problem customers have with Vercel, but a few. Coming from Replit though, a platform which also deals with hosting programs, one thing we got a lot was people having issues connecting domains. The thing is, each and every platform has a different system on how to hook up domains, and a lot of the platforms people were using we had absolutely no experience with before. 

For fairly simple issues like this, one might be inclined to create an FAQ section on their docs, but I personally believe this is one of the various parts of a website people tend to skip over and ignore. A better solution would actually to create short 30-90 second video tutorials showing how to accomplish various tasks and fix various issues. These tutorials are easily digestable by many and the short watch time means it is perfect for sites like Tiktok. Platforms like [VSCode](https://tiktok.com/@vscode) and [Replit](https://tiktok.com/@replit) have both taken such strategies with great success. The visual stimulation of a video after having looked at lines of text on a screen for hours on end until they start to merge together almost gives the user a reset, allowing a different part of their brain to work, and helping relieve boredom/exhaustion with the task at hand. 

Additionally, these short tutorials would be incredibly useful long term from a marketing perspective, as someone might find one of these tutorials on a youtube channel, tiktok account, etc, and then follow/subscribe, which would allow for them to be shown further tutorials or even marketing material. Furthermore, such videos could introduce users to Vercel who are not familiar with the platform, as we all know how a major part of sites like Youtube and Tiktok is introducing people to new creators to watch.

I hope this provided some insight on one way the support flow of Vercel can be improved, especially with those pesky questions which have been answered so much the support team has the various responses in muscle memory (trust me, I know lol).
