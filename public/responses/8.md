*Question: What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask
Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common
problems, short-term and long-term?*

Response:

Chances are, there is no *one* most common problem customers have with Vercel but a few. Coming from Replit, though, a platform that also deals with hosting programs, one thing we got a lot was people having issues connecting domains. Each registrar has a different system on how to hook up domains, and a lot of the platforms people were using we had no experience with before. 

For reasonably simple issues like this, one might want to create an FAQ section on their docs, but I believe this is one of the various parts of a website people tend to skip over and ignore. A better solution would be to create short 30-90 second video tutorials showing how to accomplish various tasks and fix multiple issues. Many of these tutorials are easily digestible, and the short watch time means it is perfect for sites like Tiktok. Platforms like [VSCode](https://tiktok.com/@vscode) and [Replit](https://tiktok.com/@replit) have both taken such strategies with great success. After looking at lines of text on a screen for hours until they start to merge, the visual stimulation of a video gives the user a reset, allowing a different part of their brain to work and helping relieve boredom/exhaustion with the task at hand. 

Additionally, these short tutorials would be beneficial long-term from a marketing perspective. For example, someone might find one on a youtube channel, TikTok account, etc., and then follow/subscribe, allowing them to see other tutorials or marketing material. Furthermore, such videos could introduce users to Vercel who are unfamiliar with the platform. We all know that a significant part of sites like Youtube and Tiktok is to introduce people to new creators to watch.

I hope this provided some insight on one way the support flow of Vercel can be improved, especially with those pesky questions that the support team answers so much that they probably have the various responses in muscle memory (trust me, lol).
