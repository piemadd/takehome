## Why Transit?
While I used to be an enormous fan of TED talks and the like many years ago, I have moved to prefer video essays about various topics: namely transportation and programming. One can reasonably assume that every other response to this question is some programming topic, so I decided to share one of my favorite transportation video essays instead. However, if I were going to share a programming-related video essay, it would probably be a video of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague).


## Video Summary
This video focuses on the proposed Amtrak ConnectsUS Map (below) and Amtrak's plan for increased passenger service by 2035.

Additionally, and more importantly, the video talks about the struggles Amtrak has faced with new routes and increased service when it comes to hosting railroads, the railroads that own most of the tracks that Amtrak runs on.

While most of the video does focus on the shortcomings Amtrak could face, at around the 12-minute mark, Alex makes an excellent point: even in the states where the odds are stacked the most against Amtrak, such as those in the sunbelt, simply the existence of public support can make things happen, which we have seen with the proposed New Orleans, LA --> Mobile, AL route.

## Why?
Now, you may be wondering why this video left a positive impression on me, especially since it pointed out the various challenges Amtrak will face while trying to establish these routes. The reason why extends a bit past the video into the efforts of multiple people to make it happen. The ConnectUS team has taken a new approach to attract interest from people, especially younger ones like me, and it's working. For example, after CSX claimed that some of their track would be too busy for new Amtrak trains, Amtrak turned around and set up a [Twitch Stream](https://twitter.com/AmtrakConnects/status/1511750786686066692) to show how few trains operate on the segment, and people have loved it. 

The mindset people are getting from Amtrak's influence is precisely what Amtrak needs to expand and improve over the next ten years. It makes me happy that people in cities like Atlanta won't need to drive, take the bus, or fly to nearby cities, such as Macon and Savannah. This is especially so because trains are more efficient than cars, busses, and planes over shorter distances (most of these new routes are).

## Conclusion
In short, this video has left a positive impression on me for a few reasons. Still, more importantly, it and the content related to it has left a positive impression on others, even those who aren't railfans. Now, if it isn't apparent already, I am an avid train nerd, which is one of the reasons why this was the video I chose. Still, I want to clarify that my reasoning expands beyond just that, mainly the optimism for a greener and cleaner future for the US, something I think anyone can get on board with.

I am glad you've taken the time out of your day to read this small excerpt from me, myself, and I, and I hope you enjoyed it!
