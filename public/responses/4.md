*Question: Imagine a customer reaches out in our GitHub community asking "How do I do a redirect from /hello-vercel to https://vercel.com?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?*

Response:

Hey there [person], hope you're having a wonderful day!

Depending on what you're using, there are a few ways you can accomplish this. For example, if you're using something like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), you could add the following snippet to your `next.config.js` file to redirect every request from `/hello-vercel` to `https://vercel.com`:


```js
module.exports = {
    async redirects() {
        return [
            {
                source: '/hello-vercel',
                destination: 'https://vercel.com',
                permanent: false, // false for temporary redirect, true for a permanent redirect. more info here: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains#redirect-status-codes
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

To add more redirects besides the one given, you could simply add more objects to the array that `redirects()` returns.

Now in the chance you aren't using `Next.js` or want to keep your redirects separate from your actual code and cofig, can also use a `vercel.json` file at your project root. You can read up more on the `vercel.json` file [here](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#project-configuration/redirects), but here is a simple example of what your file might look like:

```json
{
    "redirects": [
        {
            "source": "/hello-vercel",
            "destination": "https://vercel.com/",
            "permanent": false
        }
    ]
}
```

If you have any other questions, feel free to reply with them and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
  
  
Sincerely,
