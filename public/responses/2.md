*Question: What do you want to learn, or do more of, at work?*

Response: 

There are various things I want to learn and do more of at work, but I have taken some time to boil it down to an essential few elements:

1. Get better at developing software, especially on the front end and with Next.js. Writing software and making something functional is one thing; writing good code and making a good app is entirely different. An excellent example of this is how far I've come with [Amtraker](https://amtraker) as [the original version](https://beta.amtrak.cc/) being hard to use and having spaghetti code would be an understatement. 

2. Learn how to write documentation correctly. I have plenty of experience making things, but making it easy for others to create with my things is something I am relatively new to. I have seen some [great docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) (ok [these are good too](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/stable/general/welcome)) while being a developer and want to write docs as close in quality to those as popular.

3. Share my interests with others. Coming from a community manager position that was more of a community manager, social media manager, and developer role has given me the drive to share with others my various passions, such as [railfanning](https://youtu.be/QrxjoRl6rEk?t=75), [vfx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFS51s2bS_M), and [computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCwqBrUNP3Q).
